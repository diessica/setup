# setup!
This is my life, along with [my dotfiles](https://github.com/diessica/dotfiles) *(important stuff there!)* and [favourites](https://github.com/diessica/favourites), on **OS X Yosemite**. I have a 13.3" Macbook Pro with Retina, which I sometimes like to put in my backpack just because.


## brick by brick...
1. Check for **Software Update** and install it if there is any: `$ sudo softwareupdate -i -r`.
