# setup!
This is my life, along with [my dotfiles](https://github.com/diessica/dotfiles) *(important stuff there!)* and [favourites](https://github.com/diessica/favourites), on **OS X Yosemite**. I have a 13.3" Macbook Pro with Retina, which I sometimes like to put in my backpack just because.


## brick by brick...
1. Check for **Software Update** and install it if there is any: `$ sudo softwareupdate -i -r`.

2. Install [dotfiles](https://github.com/diessica/dotfiles) (*instructions available in the repository*), which includes my OS X's preferences, cool CLIs, terminal tweaks and a lot of utils.

3. Install applications from [applications.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diessica/setup/master/applications.sh): `$ ./applications.sh`.

  > :exclamation: **Make sure to...**<br>
  > Move apps from `/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/` to `/Applications`.<br>
  > Remove installation files from `/Library/Caches/Homebrew`.

4. Generate SSH keys (*instructions on [GitHub's official guide](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/#platform-mac)*).
